"""
This program converts the text file "symmetries.txt" into a Python list.
Each element of the list represents a manifold's name followed by its volume formula symmetries.

Each symmetry is a list of five integers [a, b, c, d, n], which corresponds to the matrix:
    [a/n  b/n]
    [c/n  d/n]  
in PSL(2, Q), where a*d - b*c = nÂ².

Example:
    ['m136', [0, 4, 1, 0, 2], [1, 0, 0, -1, 1], [0, -4, 1, 0, 2]]
